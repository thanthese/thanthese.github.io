I host my static sites here. Active projects:

# [Weights timer](https://thanthese.github.io/weights-timer.html)

The simplest possible timer. A url like this:

    https://thanthese.github.io/weights-timer.html?s=5&r=3

Will set it for 5 sets with 3 minutes rest between each one. I keep the urls right in my [workflowy](https://workflowy.com) exercise list. Very lightweight workout app.

# [Echo-er](https://thanthese.github.io/echo-er.html)

The simplest possible recorder. First button press starts recording, second starts playback. No saving, looping, sharing -- no nothin'. Makes it easy to get feedback on your musical endeavors.


# [Memorizer](https://thanthese.github.io/memorizer.html)

Simple method for memorizing poems.
